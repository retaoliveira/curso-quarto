    "text": "Figure Basics\nIn Pandoc markdown, a figure is created whenever a captioned image appears by-itself in a paragraph. For example:\n![Elephant](elephant.png)\nThis results in the following treatment for various output types:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTML\nPDF\nWord\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that for LaTeX / PDF output figures are automatically numbered (you can arrange for figures to be numbered in other formats using Cross References).\n\nLinked Figures\nWhen rendering with Quarto, you can enclose a figure within a link and it will still be treated within output as a captioned figure. For example:\n[![Elephant](elephant.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant)\n\n\nFigure Alignment\nFigures are center aligned by default. Add the fig-align attribute to the image to use a different alignment. For example:\n![Elephant](elephant.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\nNote that figure captions are left aligned to accommodate longer caption text (which looks odd when center aligned).\n\n\nAlt Text\nYou can add alternative text to a figure by adding the fig-alt attribute to the image. For example, the following Markdown…\n![](elephant.png){fig-alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\"}\n… will create the following HTML with the corresponding alt tag:\n&lt;img src=\"elephant.png\" alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\"&gt;\nNote that the figure caption, title, and alt text can all be different. For example, the following code…\n![Elephant](elephant.png \"Title: An elephant\"){fig-alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\"}\n…produces this HTML:\n&lt;img src=\"elephant.png\" title=\"Title: An elephant\" alt=\"A drawing of an elephant.\"&gt;\n\n\nMultiformat Figures\nYou can write markdown that provides a distinct image file format depending on the target output format. To do this simply leave-off the extension, for example:\n![](elephant)\nBy default this will look for elephant.png, however if you are rendering to PDF it will look for elephant.pdf. You can customize this behavior using the default-image-extension option. For example:\nformat:\n  html:\n    default-image-extension: svg\n  pdf:\n    default-image-extension: tex"

    "section": "LaTeX Figures",
    "text": "LaTeX Figures\nThis section describes some figure handling options that are specific to LaTeX output.\nOne very important thing to note is that using the fig-env and fig-pos options described below will trigger the creation of a LaTeX floating environment (most often \\begin{figure}). Depending upon where this LaTeX is generated it (e.g. is it within another \\begin{figure}) this could generate invalid LaTeX. To be on the safe side these attributes should typically only be used for images at the very top level of your document.\n\nEnvironments\nThere are a number of LaTeX packages that provide custom figure environments. For example, the mdframed package includes an mdframed environment used to enclose figures in a special border style. By default, Quarto uses the standard figure environment, but you can use the fig-env attribute to specify a custom one. For example:\n---\ntitle: \"Sidenotes\"\nformat:\n  pdf:\n    include-in-header: \n      text: |\n        \\usepackage{mdframed}\n---\n\n![Elephant](elephant.png){fig-env=\"mdframed\"}\n\n\nFigure Position\nThe default LaTeX figure is a floating environment, so the specific location it appears in your document will depend on its size and the nature of the other content around it. You can exercise some control over this behavior using the fig-pos option. The fig-pos option provides a placement specifier for the figure environment. For example, the ht in this LaTeX snippet is the fig-pos:\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\n\\end{figure}\nYou can specify fig-pos either at the document level, as a executable code block option, or within markdown. Here we do all three:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nformat:\n  pdf:\n    fig-pos: 'h'\n---\n\n```{python}\n#| fig-pos: 't'\n\n```\n\n![](figure.png){fig.pos='b'}\nSee this article for additional details on LaTeX figure positioning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigures and Code Blocks\n\n\n\nIf your figure was generated by an executable code block and the code was included in the output (echo: true), then fig-pos will be set to H by default (to try to keep it alongside the code that generated it). In all other cases, default LaTeX handing of figure position is used unless you specify an explicit fig-pos.\n\n\n\n\nPGF/TikZ Graphics\nIf you are creating LaTeX output, Quarto will automatically emit the correct LaTeX for markdown images that reference .tex files containg PGF/TikZ vector graphics. For example, the following markdown images:\n![](image1.tex)\n\n![](image2.tex){width=80%}\nWill be written to LaTeX as:\n\\input{image1.tex}\n\n\\resizebox{0.8\\linewidth}{!}{\\input{image2.tex}}\nAs shown above, width and height percentages are automatically converted to \\linewidth scaled. Alternatively you can specify custom LaTeX for the width and height arguments of \\resizebox."

If you are only targeting a single format you can place it alongside other format specific options.\nValid values for the caption location include:\n\n\n\nValue\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntop\nPosition the caption above the figure.\n\n\nbottom\nPosition the caption below the figure.\n\n\nmargin\nPosition the caption in the margin.\n\n\n\nSee the article on Article Layout for additional details on placing captions in the margin."

    "section": "Custom Layouts",
    "text": "Custom Layouts\nThe examples above used the layout-ncol or layout-nrow attributes to create straightforward layouts where all columns are of equal sizes. The layout attribute enables the creation of much more complex layouts.\nFor example, this defines a layout with two equally sized figures in the first row, then another image that spans the entire second row:\n::: {layout=\"[[1,1], [1]]\"}\n![Surus](surus.png)\n\n![Hanno](hanno.png)\n\n![Lin Wang](lin-wang.png)\n:::\n\nThe layout attribute is a 2-dimensional array where the first dimension defines rows and the second columns. In this case \"layout=\"[[1,1], [1]]\" translates to: create two rows, the first of which has two columns of equal size and the second of which has a single column.\nNote that the numbers in a row are arbitrary and don’t need to add up to a particular total. You can therefore use whatever scheme is most natural. For example, here we define columns that occupy varying percentage widths of the row:\n::: {layout=\"[[70,30], [100]]\"}\n![Surus](surus.png)\n\n![Hanno](hanno.png)\n\n![Lin Wang](lin-wang.png)\n:::\nYou can also use negative values to create space between elements. For example:\n::: {layout=\"[[40,-20,40], [100]]\"}\n![Surus](surus.png)\n\n![Hanno](hanno.png)\n\n![Lin Wang](lin-wang.png)\n:::\n\n\nVertical Alignment\nIf you have a layout with a row of images of differing heights, you can control their vertical alignment using the layout-valign attribute. A simple example:\n::: {layout=\"[25,-2,10]\" layout-valign=\"bottom\"}\n![Surus](surus.png)\n\n![Lin Wang](lin-wang.png)\n:::\n\nNote that vertical alignment isn’t limited to images, you can also vertically align any other elements that are included in a panel."

When applying captions to computational output you can optionally include a label with a fig- prefix—if you do this then the figure will be numbered and cross-referenceable.\n\nJupyterKnitr\n\n\n``` {{python}}\n#| label: fig-charts\n#| fig-cap: Charts\n#| fig-subcap: \n#|   - \"First\"\n#|   - \"Second\"\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot([1,23,2,4])\nplt.show()\n\nplt.plot([8,65,23,90])\nplt.show()\n```\n\n\n\n``` {{r}}\n#| label: fig-charts\n#| fig-cap: Charts\n#| fig-subcap: \n#|   - \"Cars\"\n#|   - \"Pressure\"\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n\nplot(cars)\nplot(pressure)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Layout\nThe layout works the same way for figures produced by Knitr or Jupyter. For example, here’s an Rmd code chunk that produces 3 plots and defines a custom layout for them:\n``` {{r}}\n#| layout: [[45,-10, 45], [100]]\n\nplot(cars)\nplot(pressure)\nplot(mtcars)\n```"

As a reminder, document options are specified in YAML within a “Raw” cell at the beginning of the notebook. To create a Raw cell, add a cell at the top of the notebook and set its type to Raw using the notebook toolbar:\n\nNow, let’s add some basic document metadata and a default output format.\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto Document\"\nauthor: \"Norah Jones\"\nformat: pdf\njupyter: python3\n---\n\nWe specified pdf as the default output format (if we exclude the format option then it will default to html).\nLet’s add some options to control our PDF output.\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto Document\"\nauthor: \"Norah Jones\"\nformat: \n  pdf: \n    toc: true\n    number-sections: true\njupyter: python3\n---\n\n\n\nMultiple Formats\nSome documents you create will have only a single output format, however in many cases it will be desirable to support multiple formats.

For example, for the HTML output we want the user to have control over whether to show or hide the code (code-fold: true) and use katex for math text. For PDF we define some margins. The docx format is a bit different—it specifies docx: default. This means just use all of the default options for the format."

    "title": "Tutorial: Authoring",
    "section": "Output Formats",
    "text": "Output Formats\nQuarto supports rendering notebooks to dozens of different output formats. By default, the html format is used, but you can specify an alternate format (or formats) within document options.\n\nFormat Options\nYou can choose the format you want to render your Quarto document to at the time of creating your new document. To create a new document, go to File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document… Alternatively, use the command palette (accessible via Ctrl+Shift+P), search for Create a new Quarto document and hit return.\nIn the Title field, give a title for your document (e.g. the screenshot below suggests “Housing Prices”) and add your name to the Author field. Next, you will select the output format for your document. By default, RStudio suggests using HTML as the output, let’s leave that default for now.\n\n\n\n\n\nA new document will be created with the following YAML.\n---\ntitle: \"Housing Prices\"\nauthor: \"Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel\"\n---\nNote that our format choice (HTML) is not even reflected in the YAML as it is the default output format for Quarto documents. However you can directly edit the YAML to change the output format, e.g. to PDF (pdf) or MS Word (docx). Add format: pdf to your document’s YAML as shown below.\n---\ntitle: \"Housing Prices\"\nauthor: \"Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel\"\nformat: pdf\n---\nUnfortunately, this document has no content, so rendering it would not result in very interesting output. To make it a bit easier to demonstrate all the features we want to highlight in this tutorial, let’s close this empty document and start with one that has a little bit of content in it. If you would like to follow along step-by-step in your own environment, download the Quarto document (.qmd) below and open it in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download authoring.qmd\n\n\n\nIn order to create PDFs you will need to install a recent distribution of LaTeX. We recommend the use of TinyTeX (which is based on TexLive), which you can install with the following command:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto install tool tinytex\n\nSee the article on PDF Engines for details on using other LaTeX distributions and PDF compilation engines.\nOnce you have LaTeX setup, click on  Render (or use the keyboard shortcut ⇧⌘K). We recommend also checking the box for Render on Save for a live preview of your changes. As shown below, you should see the rendered PDF in the Viewer in RStudio.\n\nNext, let’s add an option to the YAML, e.g. to add line numbers to the code chunks (code-line-numbers: true). Add this option to your document’s YAML as shown below, paying attention to the indentation scheme. Under format: our format choice pdf is indented (with two spaces) and it’s followed by : to indicate that further options for that format will be specified. In the next line, further indented by two spaces, we add code-line-numbers: true.\n---\ntitle: \"Housing Prices\"\nauthor: \"Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel\"\nformat:\n  pdf:\n    code-line-numbers: true\n---\nIf you checked Render on Save earlier, just save the document after making this change for a live preview. Otherwise render the document to see your updates reflected, including a table of contents that looks like the following.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn incredibly exciting format option that we won’t go into too much detail in this tutorial is revealjs. Yes, you can make presentations with Quarto as well! In fact, Quarto supports supports a variety of formats for creating presentations, including revealjs for HTML slides, pptx for PowerPoint, and beamer for LaTeX/PDF. The Presentations article gives a thorough walk through of creating slide decks with Quarto.\n\n\nMultiple Formats\nSome documents you create will have only a single output format, however in many cases it will be desirable to support multiple formats. Let’s add the html and docx formats to our document and modify some options specific to each format.\n---\ntitle: \"Housing Prices\"\nauthor: \"Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel\"\nhighlight-style: pygments\nformat:\n  html: \n    code-fold: true\n    html-math-method: katex\n  pdf:\n    geometry: \n      - top=30mm\n      - left=30mm\n  docx: default\n---\nThere’s a lot to take in here! Let’s break it down a bit. The first two lines are generic document metadata that aren’t related to output formats at all.\n---\ntitle: \"Housing Prices\"\nauthor: \"Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel\"\n---\nThe next line is a document format option that applies to all formats, which is why it is specified at the root level.\n---\nhighlight-style: pygments\n---\nNext, we have the format option, where we provide format-specific options.\n---\nformat:\n  html: \n    code-fold: true\n    html-math-method: katex\n  pdf:\n    geometry: \n      - top=30mm\n      - left=30mm\n  docx: default\n---\nThe html and pdf formats each provide an option or two. For example, for the HTML output we want the user to have control over whether to show or hide the code (code-fold: true) and use katex for math text. For PDF we define some margins. The docx format is a bit different—it specifies docx: default. This indicates that we just want to use all of the default options for the format."

You’ll edit code and markdown in RStudio just as you would with any computational document (e.g. R Markdown), and preview the rendered document in the Viewer tab as you work.\nThe following is a Quarto document with the extension .qmd (on the left) along with its rendered version as HTML (on the right).

    "text": "Authoring\nIn the image below we can see the same document in the two modes of the RStudio editor: visual (on the left) and source (on the right). RStudio’s visual editor offers an WYSIWYM authoring experience for markdown. For formatting (e.g. bolding text) you can use the toolbar, a keyboard shortcut (⌘B), or the markdown construct (**bold**). The plain text source code underlying the document is written for you and you can view/edit it at any point by switching to source mode for editing. You can toggle back and forth these two modes by clicking on Source and Visual in the editor toolbar (or using the keyboard shortcut ⌘⇧ F4).\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s turn our attention to the contents of our Quarto document. The file contains three types of content: a YAML header, code chunks, and markdown text.\n\nYAML header\nAn (optional) YAML header demarcated by three dashes (---) on either end.\n---\ntitle: \"Hello, Quarto\"\nformat: html\neditor: visual\n---\nWhen rendered, the title , \"Hello, Quarto\", will appear at the top of the rendered document with a larger font size than the rest of the document. The other two YAML fields in denote that the output should be in html format and the document should open in the visual editor, by default.\nThe basic syntax of YAML uses key-value pairs in the format key: value. Other YAML fields commonly found in headers of documents include metadata like author, subtitle, date as well as customization options like theme, fontcolor, fig-width, etc. You can find out about all available YAML fields for HTML documents here. The available YAML fields vary based on document format, e.g. see here for YAML fields for PDF documents and here for MS Word.\n\n\nCode chunks\nR code chunks identified with {r} with (optional) chunk options, in YAML style, identified by #| at the beginning of the line.\n```{r}\n#| label: load-packages\n#| include: false\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n```\nIn this case the label of the code chunk is load-packages and we set include to false to indicate that we don’t want the chunk itself or any of its outputs in the rendered documents.\nIn addition to rendering the complete document to view the results of code chunks you can also run each code chunk interactively in the RStudio editor by clicking the  icon or keyboard shortcut (⇧⌘⏎). RStudio executes the code and displays the results either inline within your file or in the Console, depending on your preference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown text\nText with formatting, including section headers, hyperlinks, an embedded image, and an inline code chunk.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto uses markdown syntax for text. If using the visual editor, you won’t need to learn much markdown syntax for authoring your document as you can use the menus and shortcuts to add a header, bold text, insert a table, etc. If using the source editor, you can achieve these with markdown expressions like ##, **bold**, etc."

It you prefer, you can configure the Quarto extension to render whenever you save a document. See the documentation on Render on Save for additional details.\n\n\nRunning Cells\nYou don’t need to fully render documents in order to iterate on code cells. You’ll notice that there is a Run Cell button above the code cell. Click that button to execute the cell (output is shown side by side in the Jupyter interactive console):\n\nExecute the current cell with Ctrl+Shift+Enter, the current line(s) with Ctrl+Enter, or previous cells with Ctrl+Alt+P (note that on the Mac you should use Cmd rather than Ctrl as the prefix for all Quarto keyboard shortcuts).\nThere are few different types of content in hello.qmd, let’s work a bit with each type."

Aqueles que não aderirem a tais padrões de comportamento podem estar sujeitos ao regime disciplinar da instituição. A cortesia profissional e a sensibilidade são especialmente importantes no que diz respeito a indivíduos e discussões que lidam com diferenças de raça, cor, cultura, religião, credo, política, status de veterano, orientação sexual, gênero, identidade e expressão de gênero, idade, deficiência e nacionalidades. As listas de classes são fornecidas ao instrutor com o nome legal do aluno. Terei prazer em honrar seu pedido de dirigir-se a você por um nome alternativo ou pronome de gênero. Por favor, me informe essa preferência no início do semestre para que eu possa fazer as mudanças apropriadas em seus registros.\nNão serão tolerados atos de discriminação ou assédio contra ou por qualquer funcionário ou estudante.\nHonestidade acadêmica é um princípio fundamental desta disciplina. Desonestidade acadêmica configura-se por: cópias literais de textos ou ideias sem citação de fonte, fabricações e falsificações de qualquer natureza, plágio, mentira, suborno, comportamento ameaçador ou cumplicidade com desonestidade acadêmica em qualquer nível. Os estudantes que forem considerados em violação da política de integridade acadêmica estarão sujeitos tanto a sanções acadêmicas do membro docente quanto a sanções não acadêmicas. Se você tiver alguma dúvida sobre citações adequadas, configuração de plágio, etc., por favor, não hesite em perguntar!"

    "section": "Criando documentos",
    "text": "Criando documentos\nNa imagem abaixo podemos ver o mesmo documento nos dois modos do editor do RStudio: visual (à esquerda) e fonte (à direita). O editor visual do RStudio oferece uma experiência de autoria WYSIWYM por markdown. Para formatação você pode utilizar a barra de ferramentas, um atalho de teclado (⌘B), ou a construção de marcação para formato (** negrito**). O código fonte em texto puro subjacente ao documento é escrito por você e você pode visualizá-lo/editá-lo em qualquer ponto, mudando para o modo fonte para edição. Você pode alternar entre estes dois modos clicando em Source* e Visual* na barra de ferramentas do editor (ou usando o atalho de teclado ⌘⇧ F4).\n\n\n\n\n\nA seguir, vamos voltar nossa atenção para o conteúdo de nosso documento Quarto. O arquivo contém três tipos de conteúdo: um cabeçalho YAML, pedaços de código e texto em markdown.\n\nCabeçalho YAML\nÉ um cabeçalho (opcional) YAML demarcado por três traços (---) em ambas as extremidades.\nQuando renderizado, o título, \"Olá, Quarto\", aparecerá no topo do documento com um tamanho de fonte maior do que o resto do documento. Os outros dois campos YAML denotam que a saída deve estar em formato “html” e o documento deve abrir no “editor” “visual”, por padrão.\nA sintaxe básica da YAML utiliza pares de valores chave no formato “chave: valor”. Outros campos do YAML comumente encontrados em cabeçalhos de documentos incluem metadados como “autor”, “subtítulo”, “data”, assim como opções de personalização como “tema”, “cor de botão”, “largura de figura”, etc. Você pode aprender sobre todos os campos YAML disponíveis para documentos HTML aqui. Os campos YAML disponíveis variam de acordo com o formato do documento, por exemplo, veja aqui para documentos em PDF e aqui para MS Word.\n\n\nChunks de código\nPedaços de código são identificados com {r} com opções (opcionais) em estilo YAML, identificados por #| no início da linha.\n```{r}\n#| label: load-packages\n#| include: false\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n```\nNeste caso, o “rótulo” do trecho de código é “load-packages” e nós definimos “include” para “false” para indicar que não queremos o trecho em si ou nenhuma de suas saídas nos documentos apresentados.\nAlém de renderizar o documento completo para visualizar os resultados dos trechos de código, você também pode executar cada trecho de código interativamente no editor do RStudio, clicando no ícone  ou atalho de teclado (⇧⌘⏎). O RStudio executa o código e exibe os resultados em linha dentro de seu arquivo ou no Console, dependendo de sua preferência.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexto markdown\nTexto markdown possui formatação, incluindo cabeçalhos de seção, hyperlinks, uma imagem embutida e um trecho de código em linha.\n\n\n\n\n\nO Quarto usa a sintaxe markdown para o texto. Se usar o editor visual, você não precisará aprender muita sintaxe de markdown para criar seu documento, pois você pode usar os menus e atalhos para adicionar um cabeçalho, texto em negrito, inserir uma tabela, etc. Se utilizar o editor do código fonte, você poderá formatar o texto com expressões marcadas como ##, ***negrito**, etc."

Adicione uma bibliografia ao seu documento usando o campo de metadados da bibliografia YAML. Por exemplo:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nbibliography: references.bib\n---\nO Quarto utilizará Pandoc para gerar automaticamente citações e uma bibliografia em vários estilos. Para usar esse recurso, você precisará:\n\nUm documento quarto formatado com citações (ver Citation Markdown).\nUma fonte de dados bibliográficos, por exemplo, um arquivo BibLaTeX (.bib) ou BibTeX (.bibtex).\nOpcionalmente, um arquivo CSL que especifica a formatação a ser usada na geração das citações e bibliografia. Baixe o arquivo CSL de interesse no repositório do Zotero ou em outra fonte de arquivos CSL confiável. Usando o Better Biblatex ou o Bibtex, o formato da citação e da lista de referências já é exportado na gereção do arquivo de referências.\n\nVocê pode fornecer mais de um arquivo bibliográfico, se desejar, definindo o valor do campo bibliográfico para uma matriz YAML.\n\n\n\nO Quarto utiliza a representação padrão Pandoc markdown para citações (por exemplo [@citação]) - as citações vão dentro de colchetes e são separadas por ponto-e-vírgula. Cada citação deve ter uma chave, composta de ‘@’ + o identificador da citação do banco de dados. A chave de citação deve começar com uma letra, dígito, ou _, e pode conter alfanuméricos, _, e caracteres de pontuação interna (:.#$%&-+?&lt;&gt;~~/).

Por padrão, a Pandoc usará o formato Chicago Manual of Style author-date, mas você pode especificar uma formatação personalizada usando CSL (Citation Style Language). Para fornecer o estilo de citação personalizada, forneça um caminho para um arquivo CSL usando o campo de metadados csl em seu documento, por exemplo:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: nature.csl\n---\nYou pode encontrar arquivos CSL ou aprender mais sobre o uso de estilos no CSL Project. Você pode consultar a lista de mais de 8.500 definições Creative Commons de CSL no Projeto CSL central repository ou utilizar o style repository do Zotero.\n\n\n\nPara acrescentar uma citação, digamos de um DOI,\n\n- Ir para Inserir &gt; Citação\n- Escolha DOI no menu à esquerda\n- Cole o DOI do artigo ou livro que você deseja citar na caixa de busca e clique em search\n- Uma vez localizado o trabalho que você deseja citar, clique em Inserir\n\n\nÉ isso aí, você inseriu sua primeira citação!
