  abstract = {This study was conducted in the context of health service planning in an environment of changing government strategies for regional, rural and remote area health care and telecommunications infrastructure planning in Western Australia. The study provides an account of the State Government of Western Australia's planning for the implementation of a telecommunications network infrastructure, and specifically the Telehealth Project, conducted between 1998 and 2002. The purpose of this study was to examine influences on community participation in planning within the dynamic political, economic and social forces that impact on the development of regional, rural and remote area health services. Specifically, the study outlines the issues and barriers in providing for significant local participation in projects that are centrally initiated and controlled. It examines the influences in planning for projects that incorporate local community based beliefs and needs, the requirements of collaborating with multiple state and national government departments, and the private sector. This study was situated within the interpretive paradigm, and is conceptualised within Donabedian's (1969) framework for assessing and assuring quality in health care. The methodological approach is bound within a case study and consists of a participatory action research approach. The research method uses the single case to undertake in-depth interviews, observations and a survey to collect data from community, government and industry members as a basis for reflection and action. The findings of the study clearly indicated that there was consensus between all rural, remote and metropolitan area participants that telecommunications did offer the opportunity to provide increased, improved or alternative health services. However, there were a number of obstacles to the success of the planning process, including a lack of local community inclusion in planning committees, poor communication within central government agencies, overuse of external consultants, a bias toward the medical view, a limited scope of invitation to contribute, and local information being overlooked in the final implementation plan. Analysis of planning for the Telehealth Project reveals the implications of organisational and political stakeholders making final decisions about outcomes; and provides a reminder of the importance of engaging communities authentically when planning for health and telecommunications services which involve the public and private sectors.

Only recently has theoretical reflection on planning explicitly and directly addressed the question of the power planning necessarily possesses, trying to grasp the difference between physiological situations and pathological conditions, where there is a distortion of the relationship with decision-making, and other, power in implementing technical action. But this has not clarified the relationship properly. The paper addresses the issue by reflecting on some interpretative categories of power, their transposition onto the territorial urban dimension and their effects in terms of planning, so as to obtain the recognition of power as an important key to understanding spatial and functional organisation and to highlight how the link between planning and power often does not produce effects of collective safeguarding but of the defence of a few to the detriment of many.},

This paper introduces the concept of `knowledge generation' as a potentially useful mechanism for closing the gap between support tools and planning practice. Through two specific Dutch planning cases, we analyze the applicability of this concept in supporting integrated LUT strategy development. The paper focuses on the developed strategies, how these differ from current practice, and how knowledge generation supported their development. We argue that socialization produces shared strategies and that effective socialization needs to be supported by efficient mutual exchange between tacit and explicit knowledge.

However, in the Netherlands (and in other countries), such integration is scarcely present in daily planning practice (see, for instance, Hull and Tricker 2006). If anything, one can speak of policy coordination rather than `integration'; i.e. it is dialogue or information exchange which is geared at avoiding conflicts between projects, but does not seek to establish similar policy goals (Stead et al. 2004). Achieving integration in earlier phases of planning (for example, strategy development, goal orientation or visioning) can potentially produce shared policy goals, which would promote mutually reinforcing (instead of obstructing) land use and transport measures. However, for this to happen, a transition on its own is needed.},

  abstract = {This study was conducted in the context of health service planning in an environment of changing government strategies for regional, rural and remote area health care and telecommunications infrastructure planning in Western Australia. The study provides an account of the State Government of Western Australia's planning for the implementation of a telecommunications network infrastructure, and specifically the Telehealth Project, conducted between 1998 and 2002. The purpose of this study was to examine influences on community participation in planning within the dynamic political, economic and social forces that impact on the development of regional, rural and remote area health services. Specifically, the study outlines the issues and barriers in providing for significant local participation in projects that are centrally initiated and controlled. It examines the influences in planning for projects that incorporate local community based beliefs and needs, the requirements of collaborating with multiple state and national government departments, and the private sector. This study was situated within the interpretive paradigm, and is conceptualised within Donabedian's (1969) framework for assessing and assuring quality in health care. The methodological approach is bound within a case study and consists of a participatory action research approach. The research method uses the single case to undertake in-depth interviews, observations and a survey to collect data from community, government and industry members as a basis for reflection and action. The findings of the study clearly indicated that there was consensus between all rural, remote and metropolitan area participants that telecommunications did offer the opportunity to provide increased, improved or alternative health services. However, there were a number of obstacles to the success of the planning process, including a lack of local community inclusion in planning committees, poor communication within central government agencies, overuse of external consultants, a bias toward the medical view, a limited scope of invitation to contribute, and local information being overlooked in the final implementation plan. Analysis of planning for the Telehealth Project reveals the implications of organisational and political stakeholders making final decisions about outcomes; and provides a reminder of the importance of engaging communities authentically when planning for health and telecommunications services which involve the public and private sectors. The originality and significance of this study stems from understanding how technology can advance community health; through measures such as the use of community participation strategies, through authentic community based leadership, truly representative participants, decentralised decision making, a focus on community based health needs and change management strategies that include all of these. Consequently, the study advances knowledge of community participation in planning and the evidence suggests implications for practice, education and further research.},

  abstract = {There is broad and growing consensus regarding the central place of integrated Land Use and Transport (LUT) strategy development in establishing more efficient and sustainable urban environments. However, empirical evidence shows that such integration is hard to achieve in daily planning practice, due to many institutional barriers and substantive differences. More specifically, the tools developed to support LUT strategy development have very low implementation rates in daily planning practice. This paper introduces the concept of `knowledge generation' as a potentially useful mechanism for closing the gap between support tools and planning practice. Through two specific Dutch planning cases, we analyze the applicability of this concept in supporting integrated LUT strategy development. The paper focuses on the developed strategies, how these differ from current practice, and how knowledge generation supported their development. We argue that socialization produces shared strategies and that effective socialization needs to be supported by efficient mutual exchange between tacit and explicit knowledge. We conclude by discussing the implications of this argument for the wider practice of LUT planning integration.},
